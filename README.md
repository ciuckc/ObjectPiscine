## Introduction

The aim of these projects and short exercises is to teach about object
oriented concepts and design patterns. These concepts are not only native to
OOP, but they can be found in various other paradigms.

## UML

The Unified Modeling Language (UML), makes it possible to describe complex
systems by using words and pictures.
A model of the real data is built, to emphasize important details, and omit
less important ones, which don't serve the scope of the system. The more
information a model is supposed to give, the more difficult it becomes to
communicate and visualize the system. That's why you can have different views
of different parts of the model (example: a map can have terrain view, traffic
view, infrastructure view etc.).
UML performs the following tasks:

- communicates to all parties involved, what has to be done and that everyone
will think along the same lines, in order to avoid confusion
- visualizes facts that are only relevant for the system and nothing else.
This is done through the use of diagrams and text
- validates the consistency, completeness and correctness of the system,
and it can be used as a fact-checker
